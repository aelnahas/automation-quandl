# Tests

Here lives the automation testing. I have divided the tests into two folders:
  
  + web_tests: For all UI Testing, mainly uses selenium and page objects
  + api_tests: For the REST-API testing
  
Each folder has its own conftest, which is a script that pytest uses to setup the fixtures and environment
